Facade desgin pattern is used when there is a requirement of restricting the functionality in existing implementation.
It provides client a flexibility to use existing or restricted class object method;

-> Diff between facade and proxy :
  In proxy, proxy class implements same abstract/ interface class but in facade new abstract and concrete class implemented.
